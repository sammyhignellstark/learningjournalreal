####How do computers work?
    *Computers were designed to help us with the thinking work that we do instead of the traditional manual labor tools like wheelbarrels
    *They'd need to do 4 things:
        1. Take input
        2. Store info
        3. Process
        4. Output results
    *every computer goes through this!
    *early copmuters were wood
    *Used to be really big & old
    *they still do these same tasks but it looks different
    *ones and zeros run the inside of a computer
    *Bit is the "on" "off" form of the smallest info
    *Binary number system
        >only with 0's and 1'same
        >any number can be represented with these two numbers!!
    *text, images and sound can also be represented by numbers
    *They are assigned

####Circuits
    *simple signal: Not (flips from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1)
    *And circuits will turn up a 0 even when inputs are 1 & 0, but will output a 1 if both inputs are 1
    *Others include:
        >AND - NAND
        >NOT - NOR
        >OR - XOR
    *Can be combined for more complex options 
    *Adder will add the 0's & 1's 
    *All computer communication is just lots and lots of simple calculations

####CPU, Memory, Input & Output 
    *More info in input, memory, process, & output.

####Hardware & Software
    *Hardware (physical stuff):
        >Circuits
        >chips 
        >wires
        >speakers 
        >plugs
        >stuff
    *Software (not physical stuff):
        >code 
        >apps 
        >games 
        >websites 
        >maps
        >creative
        >analysis
    *How they interact
        >CPU is the central processing unit
        >Master chip controls all other parts of the computer
        >Magic is how it knows which circuits to use and when to use them
        >software tells the CPU what to do

    *Running multiple software's at once turns to the operating system
    *operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer

Learning to code allows you to define the problem you want to solve!
A computer is only smart when there is Input
YOU ARE THE INPUT!!!!
